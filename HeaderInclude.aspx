        <!-- Heading images (logo, pics, & horizontal nav) were originally included here as common code for 
            all forms. Web folks requested we remove that, since we couldn't exactly replicate the intranet
            look and feel. As it currently is written, it makes a blue and orange bar across the top
            with colored divs. If we ever want to put something at the top of all pages, do it here.-->
